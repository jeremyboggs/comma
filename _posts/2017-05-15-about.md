After many attempts to build a static generated website, I have finally found a custom template made by [Michael Mckeever](https://mckvr.com/). Adopting it meant a lot of tweaking but I am pretty happy with the result. For now! Here’s some information about what lies under the hood.

## Build
This website has been built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator created by Github.

## CSS
The site is built with [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/), an atomic CSS framework. Paired with [gulp-uncss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uncss) which strips out any unused css, the minified CSS is only 17kb.

## Typography
Headings are typeset in Garamond.

Paragraph text is set in system fonts so the typeface you see will depend on what platform you’re viewing this on. I’m on a mac, so I see Apple’s system font, San Francisco.

Why system fonts? Well, for speed mostly, but they also look great so I don’t think I’m sacrificing design for performance.

## Hosting
The site is hosted for free on Github pages. 

## Gulp
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used to automate certain tasks such as minifying and concatenating javascript, minifying CSS and inlining in the head of the document, and watching for changes to rebuild/reload the browser.

## Images and icons
Images are hosted locally and loaded dynamically using [lazysizes.js](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes). Images are compressed using the [tinypng-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinypng-cli). I opted for this over a lossless alternative such as [gulp-imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin) because of the superior compression it afforded. The difference was pretty staggering. Icons are loaded via an SVG sprite in the document header.
